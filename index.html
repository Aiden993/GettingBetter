        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>My name is Aiden and I like to play video games and basketball, I am currently 16 years old and I am a junior at Crest high school, and I am one of the only people in my family to attend college.</p>
        <h3>My Future</h3>
        <p>In the future I want to obtain either a computer science degree or a cyber security because of the increase in technology in our world and the security risks that come along, especially with people stealing personal information for monetary gain from other people. I want to live in a nice area, have a family, and work from home to spend time with my family.</p>
